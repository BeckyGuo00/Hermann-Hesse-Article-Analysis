# Hermann Hesse Novels Analysis

Welcome to the **Hermann Hesse Article Analysis** project ‚Äî a digital humanities study exploring the thematic and conceptual structure of Hermann Hesse's novels using computational text analysis.

## üìò Project Overview

Hermann Hesse‚Äôs novels investigate deeply personal and universal themes such as **self-discovery**, **spirituality**, and **existential struggle**. Through works like *Siddhartha*, *Steppenwolf*, and *Demian*, Hesse creates complex psychological narratives.

This project combines traditional literary interest with **digital tools** to analyze the thematic evolution and patterns across several of his novels. Using methods such as **TF-IDF**, **Cosine Similarity**, and **Topic Modeling**, the project uncovers hidden insights within Hesse‚Äôs texts.

## üîç Conclusions 

- **Low Novel Similarity**: Cosine similarity revealed that Hesse‚Äôs novels are thematically diverse, with the highest score (0.0905) between *Demian* and *Siddhartha*.
- **Theme-Specific Keywords**: TF-IDF highlighted terms like `"magister"`, `"game"` in *The Glass Bead Game* and `"river"`, `"siddhartha"` in *Siddhartha*.
- **Recurring Themes**: Topic modeling uncovered major recurring topics:
  - Topic 0: Education (`"student"`, `"instruction"`)
  - Topic 8: Politics/War (`"nation"`, `"soldier"`)
  - Topic 16: Art (`"studio"`, `"painter"`)
- **Philosophical Duality**: Frequent references to contradictions (e.g., awakening vs. sterility) reflect Hesse's introspective narrative structure.

- `data/`: Cleaned plain-text versions of selected English translations of Hesse‚Äôs novels.
- `output/`: Visualizations, similarity matrices, and topic modeling results.

## üß™ Methodology

### TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity (`doc_term_matrix.ipynb`)
- **Goals**:
  - Identify key words that define each novel.
  - Measure thematic similarity across texts.
- **Steps**:
  - Preprocessing: stop word removal, lemmatization, word filtering (>3 characters)
  - Vectorization using TF-IDF
  - Similarity computation via cosine similarity

### Topic Modeling (`topic_model.ipynb`)
- **Goals**:
  - Extract conceptual groupings of words (topics)
  - Compare topic distribution across documents
- **Steps**:
  - Focused only on **nouns**
  - TF-IDF transformation
  - Topic extraction using NMF (20 topics)
  - Similarity analysis using topic vectors

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- **Translation inconsistency**: Different English versions of Hesse‚Äôs texts varied in word choice.
- **OCR errors**: Some texts were converted from scanned PDFs, leading to misread or corrupted sections.
- **Corpus size**: Limited availability of clean full-text novels reduced analytical depth.

---

## üí° Comparative Reflection

- **TF-IDF** captures word-level uniqueness, suitable for keyword extraction but less effective for thematic analysis.
- **Topic Modeling** captures conceptual groupings and recurring themes across texts, even when vocabulary differs.
- Together, these methods provide complementary views into Hesse‚Äôs literary style and philosophical exploration.

---

## üìå Future Work

- Expand the corpus to include more novels and clean translations
- Apply **sentiment analysis**, **named entity recognition**, and **timeline-based thematic analysis**
- Visualize protagonist journeys and philosophical conflicts with network graphs
